# Count FASTQ read lengths

Each program in this repo solves the same problem: count the read lengths in a
FASTQ file. The output is a list of lines, each indicating frequency of a read
length for all read lengths found in the file.

Several implementations are given, in several languages, mostly as an exercise.
